## Perl Scripts

Scripts used to generate **animated mesh** with **3D-Studio Max** and play the animation within the **OGRE Engine**.

*You need to install a PERL interpretor first, to get this scripts running.*

The use of the scripts is explained in the tutorial **3DsMax Memo**, or you can look inside (they are commented).
