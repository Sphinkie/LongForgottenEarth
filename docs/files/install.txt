Installation Notes:
======================

>> THIS IS AN ALPHA VERSION (the game is far from finished)

Create a folder: \sphinx (or the name you want)

Copy the EXE files and run it.
This is an auto-extractible EXE file.

You should have these three directories: 
\sphinx\Release
\sphinx\media
\sphinx\savedgames

Go to \Release, and
- run config.exe for configuration
- run sphinx.exe for playing
