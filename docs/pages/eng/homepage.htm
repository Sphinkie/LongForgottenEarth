				</div>
				<p>
					LFE is the acronym of "Long Forgotten Earth". <br/>
					It's a 3D space adventure game in subjective view (first person view), in a realistic and wide universe. 
					The hero, on his spaceship "Le Sphinx", is lost deep in the Galaxy, and in search for his original planet: the Earth.
					The player has a large liberty of choices: exploration, trade, quests, meeting people and aliens civilizations, landing on planets, etc)
					in order to accomplish this quest. (few violence, however).

				</div>
				<p>
				Universe should be so huge in every dimension (including the 4th: Time),that you will have very few chance to
				meet another player. Anyway, it is possible to leave messages in Space-stations, that will be read later on
				by other players.
				The Explorer Guild allows also to communicate with other explorers, and to trade differents things. Internet connection
				during the game is recommanded but not mandatory.
