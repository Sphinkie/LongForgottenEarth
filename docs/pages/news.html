					DotScene imports are working quiet well now, so we start modeling the <b>new spaceship</b>.<br/>
					For Solar system generation, I have totally rewritten the (opensource)
					<a href="http://home.comcast.net/~brons/NerdCorner/StarGen/StarGen.html" target="new">StarGen library</a>,
					into an Object Oriented Design and C++.<br/>
					This give a new <b>StarGen 2</b> library which is also opensource, and has a dedicated
					<b>
						<a href="http://sphinkie.github.io/StarGen-II/" target="new">StarGen-II website</a>
					</b>,
					where documentation and sources are available. (<i>The purpose of this library is to generate a realistic planetary system, for
					a given star. It is used by Celestia fans, and many game-creators who need a solar system.</i>).

					For september, we are working on <b>dotScene imports</b>, and <b>solar system generation</b>.<br/>
					The game will create the planets orbiting around a star, according to realistic astrophysical rules.
					The game will also generate unique textures for each planet (temperate planets, rocky planets, gaz planets...)

					The <b>hibernation bed</b> is finally done! Now, I will take some time to include the new version of the

					I spent a lot of time on modeling the different rooms of the Spaceship. In fact, <b>3D modeling</b> takes a
					large amount of time. Especially when you are not a professional modeler, but a programmer. I have
					first to learn modeling and texturing technics...
					After modeling the hibernation Room (based on a model found on the internet), the corridors, the
					maintenance Room, the weaponry, the maproom, I start modeling the 'hibernation bed' with animation,
					particles, and a GUI interface.
