# LibNoise Doxygen Documentation

## Documentation

Doxygen documentation is at *html/index.html*.

## Building documentation

Run `doxygen.exe` from this directory.

Copy the following files from the `htmldata` into the `html` subdirectory:
- background.png
- doxygen.css
- libnoise.png

The HTML documentation contains custom headers and footers that require
certain image files to exist in the html subdirectory.  I don't know how to
get doxygen to copy these files automatically.
