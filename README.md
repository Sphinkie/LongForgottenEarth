## Status

The game was in active development phase during 2004 to 2006, but was never finished.

The Spaceship is operational (engines, computers, maintenance robots, hibernation, doors). Physics, dynamics, gravity, orbits calculations and display : functionalities are also complete. 

The Spaceship is inegaly modeled. The 3D models are not complete for all the rooms.

The solar system generator is operational, with asteroid fields, textured planets and stars (using *StarGen 2* and *libnoise* libraries).

The universe is filled with circa 3.000 real stars (from *Celestia* database).

You can walk inside the spaceship, give orders to maintenance robots, control the ship engines and use the hibernation pods.
