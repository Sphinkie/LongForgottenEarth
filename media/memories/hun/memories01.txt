I remember my childhood, in Paris, in the 2070's

Every night, I used to climb on the building's roof, and I spend hours looking at the shuttles taking off to Mars, or to the Moon.

This passion for space push me to enlist in the TC-SEU: the Terran Confederation Space Exploration Units .

They just discovered an habitable planet orbiting around Proxima-Centauri, and an exploration program was beginning.

It gonna take years for sure, but this will be a real challenge !
