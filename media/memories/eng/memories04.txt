We stayed 4 monthes at "Tycho Brahe", our training CampBase on the Moon.

Beetween the military trainings and the short sleeping periods, the only quiet moments were the the duty-guards, when we could have a small free-time to dream and look at the stars....

These four intensive monthes, made of us (peaceful scientists) mercyless soldiers.

Our objective was then explained: We must join the Flexan Colony "FX-12" and take control of it.

FLX-12 was orbiting around the RANA star, 29 light-years from Earth:  a 87-years journey  !
